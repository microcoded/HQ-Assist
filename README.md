# HQ-Assist
HQ Assist is a HQ Trivia Discord bot that connects to the HQ servers and provides information on user and game data for all regions. Because it is from 2018, it is now outdated.

## General Notes
* As this bot is from 2018, there are a few issues with compatability.
* Lack of support for new game modes.
* Code is sloppy and not modulised. This is especially noticable with the convoluted timezone conversions.
* Bearer tokens are not provided and will need to be added manually.
